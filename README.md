# Hey, I'm @EnMod!

I connect to create: websites, writing, audio, games.

### Which websites?

[Portfolio websites](https://melissadeleon.me), [landing pages](https://noelquiles.com), Vue sites, React sites. Also Svelte sites soon, my [personal site's Svelte refactor](https://github.com/EnMod/noel-quiles-www/tree/svelte-experiment) being the first!

### What writing?

Poetry, prose, the occasional review, and other musings on my blog, which is undergoing a [makeover in Svelte](https://github.com/EnMod/noel-quiles-www/tree/svelte-experiment).

### What audio?

[Game soundtracks](https://soundcloud.com/euphonyinphase/the-labyrinthine-night-main-theme) and [music experiments](https://soundcloud.com/euphonyinphase/night-of-fate-inspired).

### Which games?

[Survival horrors (ish)](https://memoirs-mythos.itch.io/the-labyrinthine-night), [text adventures](https://memoirs-mythos.itch.io/the-sieve-and-the-siphon), [minigame marathons](https://memoirs-mythos.itch.io/school-years).  I will be adding beat-em-ups to [my repetoire](https://memoirs-mythos.itch.io) very soon!
